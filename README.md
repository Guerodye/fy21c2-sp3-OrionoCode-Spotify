The Problem:
A new client heard about the work we did on ULEMHub and recommended us to this music company, Spotify â€” they want us to implement their new UI design in TailwindCSS.

They want an exact copy of what the UI/X engineer designed for these 3 screens:

Home Screen: https://static.authw.it/000_Home_Screen.png
Playlist: https://static.authw.it/001_Playlist.png
Playlist Details: https://static.authw.it/001_Playlist_2.png

#Solution
    - Method
      - Git for VCS
      - Each person chose a page
      - I created the branch feat/prentice
      - Pushed to GitHub and Vercel
      - Concepts used include positioning:absolute and relative, CSS 
Grids, CSS Flexbox, Tailwindcss properties

    - Process
      - Used PHPStorm
      - Used branching on GitHub
      - Used the CommandLine
